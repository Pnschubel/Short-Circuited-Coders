                                <li>If you are having trouble breathing, chest pains, bluish lips, or abnormal confusion, call 911 or go straight to the nearest ER.</li>

                                <li>Do not go to the ER for a COVID-19 test if you are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic - look for another provider.</li>

                                <li>If possible, visit your doctor a virtually with an online appointment.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li>If you go to the doctor, make sure to practice good hand washing and social distance where possible.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li>If you go to the doctor, avoid touching shared surfaces and use disinfectant wipes on surfaces you do have to touch.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li>Doctors will often have face masks to give you, but bring your own when you can.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li>If you go to a hospital or an ER, ask the doctor how long you should self-isolate for after the trip.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li>Don't panic. With proper precautions, going to the doctor during this pandemic is very safe.</li>

                                <li><strong>Fact:</strong> Hospitals have implemented many safety features to protect staff and patients, so if you think you need to go to the ER you should.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li>Fiction: Most symptomatic people with COVID-19 will be admitted to the hospital.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li><strong>Fact:</strong> Most people with COVID-19 will be asked to stay home, so don't go to the hospital unless your symptoms are severe.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li>Fiction: COVID-19 can be effectively beat by herd immunity, with many people getting sick and recovering.</li>
                                <br/>
                                <li><strong>Fact:</strong> 50-66% of people would need to develop antibodies before herd immunity is effective, and it is unclear how long such antibodies would last. A vaccine is the most effective way to beat COVID-19.</li>
